### 📝 **Assignment 07: Implement Many-to-Many and Self-Referencing Relationships in SQL**

#### **Objective**

Create SQL tables to demonstrate both a **Many-to-Many (M:M) relationship** and a **Self-Referencing relationship**. Populate the tables with sample data and write JOIN queries to retrieve combined information from the related tables.

### 📌 **Requirements**

#### **Part 1: Many-to-Many (M:M) Relationship**

1. **Create Tables**
   - `Students` (StudentID, Name)
   - `Courses` (CourseID, CourseName)
   - `Student_Course` (StudentID, CourseID) — junction table

2. **Populate Tables**
   - Insert at least 3 students and 3 courses.
   - Enroll students in multiple courses (populate `Student_Course`).

3. **Write JOIN Queries**
   - List all students with the courses they are enrolled in.
   - List all courses with the students enrolled in each course.

#### **Part 2: Self-Referencing Relationship**

1. **Create Table**
   - `Employees` (EmployeeID, Name, ManagerID)

2. **Populate Table**
   - Insert at least 5 employees, with some employees assigned as managers of others (use `ManagerID`).

3. **Write JOIN Queries**
   - List all employees with their manager's name.
   - List all managers and the employees who report to them.
