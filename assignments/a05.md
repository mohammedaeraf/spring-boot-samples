### **Assignment 05: Create an API to Get Products by Brand and Price Range Using JPA Derived Query**

#### **Objective**

Develop a Spring Boot application that implements an API to fetch products based on the **brand** and a given **price range** (minimum and maximum price). Use **Spring Data JPA Derived Queries** to perform this functionality.

1. **Entity Class: `Product`**
Define the `Product` entity class with the following fields:
    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `title` (String)
    - `brand` (String)
    - `price` (Double)
    - `category` (String)
2. **Database Configuration**
    - Use **H2**, **MySQL**, or any other database for persistence.
    - Ensure the `Product` table is created in the database.
3. **Repository Interface**
    - Define a derived query method in the `ProductRepository` to fetch products based on the brand and price range.
4. **Service Layer**
    - Add business logic to validate input parameters and handle exceptions.
5. **Controller**
    - Expose a **GET API** endpoint that accepts query parameters for `brand`, `minPrice`, and `maxPrice`.
6. **Testing**
    - Test the API using **Postman** or **Swagger** with various inputs.
