### üìù **Assignment 04: Extend Product Entity with Category and Brand, and Implement Advanced Search APIs**

#### Objective:

Enhance the existing `Product` entity by adding two new properties: `category` and `brand`. Update the API to support searching products by brand, category, and combinations with title.

---

### üìå **Requirements:**

1. **Update the `Product` entity class** to include:
   - `String category`
   - `String brand`
   - Add appropriate fields, getters, setters, and update constructors as needed.
   - Update any database schema or migration files if required.

2. **Update the `ProductRepository` interface** to add query methods for:
   - Finding products by brand
   - Finding products by category
   - Finding products by brand and category
   - Finding products by title, brand, and category (all combinations)
   - Use Spring Data JPA method naming conventions.

3. **Update the `ProductService` class** to implement methods that use the new repository queries.

4. **Update the controller** to add new endpoints for searching:
   - `/products/search/brand?brand=...`
   - `/products/search/category?category=...`
   - `/products/search/brand-category?brand=...&category=...`
   - `/products/search/advanced?title=...&brand=...&category=...` (all parameters optional, return products matching all provided criteria)

5. **Test your API** using Postman or curl to ensure all search endpoints work as expected.
